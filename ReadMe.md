# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

CodeYourFuture believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, preferred operating system, programming language, or text editor.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behaviour as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants to help us realise a safe and positive conference experience for everyone.

## Expected Behaviour

* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behaviour and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert conference organisers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to make a great CodeYourFuture Summit for everyone.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

* Unacceptable behaviours include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any attendees of the CodeYourFuture Summit and related events.

* Venues may be shared with sponsor staff members or members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

* Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences Of Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, organisers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of the CodeYourFuture Summit venues.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the conference without warning.

## What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behaviour

If you are subject to unacceptable behaviour, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organiser as soon as possible.

The CodeYourFuture Summit team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behaviour to feel safe for the duration of the conference. Any volunteer can connect you with a conference organiser.

## Scope
We expect all conference participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
